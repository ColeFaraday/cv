about: |
  <p align='justify'>
  I am a research scientist in the
  <b>Fundamental AI Research (FAIR)</b>
  group at
  <b>Meta</b> in NYC
  and study foundational topics in <b>machine learning</b> and
  <b>optimization</b>, recently involving
  reinforcement learning, control, transport, flows, and diffusion.
  My research is on learning systems that understand and interact with our world
  and focuses on integrating structural information and domain knowledge into
  these systems to represent non-trivial reasoning operations.
