about: '
  I am a research scientist at <b>Facebook AI (FAIR)</b> in NYC and
  study foundational topics in <b>machine learning</b> and <b>optimization</b>,
  recently involving reinforcement learning, control,
  optimal transport, and geometry.
  I am interested in developing new modeling principles
  that improve learning systems and agents that interact
  with and understand our world.
  My current focus is on optimization as non-trivial reasoning operations can be
  expressed in the language of optimization, and the lens of
  optimization brings insights into established paradigms.
